## 🚀 What is an Azure Landing Zone?

### ❓ **Definition**
An **Azure Landing Zone** is a **pre-configured, secure, and scalable environment** in Microsoft Azure that provides a foundation (or "starting point") for deploying workloads and applications in the cloud.

### 💡 **Why Use Landing Zones?**
Landing zones offer:
- Standardized architecture
- Built-in security & governance
- Scalable environment for enterprise workloads
- Faster and safer cloud adoption

### 🔺 **Key Components**
1. **Identity & Access Management** (Azure AD / Entra ID, RBAC)
2. **Networking** (VNets, subnets, DNS, ExpressRoute, etc.)
3. **Resource Organization** (management groups, subscriptions, naming conventions)
4. **Security & Governance** (Azure Policy, Blueprints, Defender for Cloud)
5. **Monitoring** (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics)
6. **Automation** (Bicep, Terraform, DevOps pipelines)

### 🔄 **Types of Landing Zones**
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Start Small and Expand** | Basic setup, easy to scale later |
| **Enterprise-Scale** | Full-featured with all guardrails |
| **CAF Terraform Module** | Microsoft’s prebuilt Terraform-based zone |
| **Custom/Partner Zones** | Built by solution partners or internal IT |
