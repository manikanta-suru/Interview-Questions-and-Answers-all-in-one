âœ…  Tell us about a time you handled a major incident.
Answer:
During a high-priority P1 issue, a storage failure caused downtime in one of our SapphireIMS ITIL Service Desk site. I led the bridge call, coordinated with the storage and VMware teams, and helped bring VMs online using backups. We restored critical services in under the SLA window, and I later documented the fix and proposed preventive measures.
