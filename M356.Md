## Introduction to Office 365
Office 365 is a subscription-based service model where users purchase licenses to access various services like Exchange Online, Office applications, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business. It operates under the SaaS (Software as a Service) model‚ÄîMicrosoft manages data storage, security, and maintenance.

## Exchange Online
Exchange Online is a cloud-based messaging platform with email, calendars, contacts, and shared tasks. Users access it through subscription plans (Plan 1, Plan 2, Office 365 business plans). Admins manage it via the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) for email flows, compliance, and security.

## Security Groups
Security groups assign permissions in bulk to users/devices. For example, adding members to a security group assigns licenses/policies efficiently.

## Distribution Groups
Distribution groups require manual membership; dynamic distribution groups use user attributes (e.g., department, location) to determine membership dynamically.

## DNS Records
Key DNS records:
- **TXT**: Domain verification, SPF/DKIM setup
- **MX**: Mail delivery servers
- **CNAME**: Outlook AutoDiscover configuration

## Administrator Roles
- **Global Administrator**: Full control over Microsoft 365
- **Global Reader**: View-only permissions without modification rights

## Shared Mailboxes
Shared mailboxes let multiple users access/send emails from a shared address. Default storage: 50 GB (expandable with license).

## Email Deletion and Retention
Deleted emails:
1. Move to "Deleted Items" (30 days retention)
2. Move to "Recoverable Items" (additional 14 days)

## Retention Tags
Three tags:
- **DPT**: Default Policy Tag
- **RPT**: Retention Policy Tag
- **Personal Tag**: User-applied retention

## Recovery of Deleted Emails
Admins use **eDiscovery/content search** to recover emails beyond user-accessible retention, if no hold is applied.

## Office 365 vs Microsoft 365
Microsoft 365 includes Office 365 **plus** Windows OS and security tools.

## Litigation Hold
