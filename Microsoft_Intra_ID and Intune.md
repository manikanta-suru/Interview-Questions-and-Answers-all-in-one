## 🔐 How to Force Password Change for All Users in a Specific Group Using Intune and Entra ID

### ❓ **Question**
How can I apply a policy in Microsoft Intune to ensure that all users in a particular Azure AD group are required to change their password?

---

### ✅ **Answer**

Microsoft Intune by itself **does not directly force an immediate password change**. However, you can achieve the desired outcome using a combination of **Intune Compliance Policies** and **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** settings.

---

### 💡 **1. Enforce Password Policies with Intune (Ongoing Enforcement)**

Intune allows you to enforce password **complexity, expiration, and length** policies for users.

#### ✔️ Steps:
1. Go to **Intune Admin Center** → [https://intune.microsoft.com](https://intune.microsoft.com)
2. Navigate to **Devices > Compliance policies**
3. Click **Create Policy** → Choose platform (e.g., Windows 10/11)
4. Under **System Security**, configure:
   - Password required
   - Minimum password length
   - Password expiration (e.g., 30 days)
   - Require complexity (uppercase, lowercase, etc.)
5. **Assign** this policy to the required **Azure AD group**

> 🟡 This **does not force immediate password change**, but ensures users comply with password rules going forward.

---

### 🔀 **2. Force Immediate Password Change (Microsoft Entra ID / PowerShell)**

To **immediately force password reset** for all users in a group, use **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** or PowerShell.

#### 📌 Manual Method (Entra Admin Center):
1. Go to **Microsoft Entra Admin Center** → [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com)
2. Go to **Users > All users**
3. Filter/select users by group
4. Click **Reset Password**
5. Enable **“Require user to change password at next sign-in”**

---

#### 💻 PowerShell Script (Bulk Reset for Group Members):
```powershell
# Connect to Azure AD
Connect-AzureAD

# Get the group ID
$groupId = (Get-AzureADGroup -SearchString "YourGroupName").ObjectId

# Get all users in that group
$users = Get-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $groupId

# Force password change at next login
foreach ($user in $users) {
    Set-AzureADUserPassword -ObjectId $user.ObjectId -ForceChangePasswordNextLogin $true
}
```

> 🛠 Requires `AzureAD` PowerShell module
