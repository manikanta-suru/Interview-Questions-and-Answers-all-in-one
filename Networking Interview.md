### 5. What is a MAC address?
A hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) for local network communication.

### 6. What is a subnet mask?
Divides an IP address into network and host portions, defining which part refers to the network.

### 7. What is the purpose of DNS?
Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses.

### 8. What is DHCP?
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - automatically assigns IP addresses to network devices.

### 9. What is a gateway?
An entry/exit point for data between networks, often connecting a local network to the internet.

### 10. Explain LAN, WAN, and MAN.
- **LAN**: Local Area Network (small area like office/home)
- **WAN**: Wide Area Network (large geographical areas)
- **MAN**: Metropolitan Area Network (city/campus)

## Intermediate Networking Questions and Answers

### 27. What is network redundancy?
Alternative paths/backup devices to ensure network reliability.

### 28. What is a collision domain?
Network segment where data packets can collide (common in hub-based networks).

### 29. What is a broadcast domain?
Network area where broadcasts are received by all devices.

### 30. What is load balancing?
Distributes network traffic across multiple servers for better performance.

## Troubleshooting Questions

### 31. Purpose of ping command?
Checks connectivity and latency between devices.

### 32. How to use traceroute?
Identifies the path packets take from source to destination.

### 33. What is Wireshark?
Network packet analyzer for capturing and troubleshooting traffic.

### 34. What is nslookup?
DNS query tool for domain name/IP address resolution.

### 35. How to secure a wireless network?
- Use WPA3 encryption
- Set strong passwords
- Disable SSID broadcasting
- Update firmware regularly

## Emerging Technologies

### 36. What is SD-WAN?
Software-Defined WAN - optimizes WAN connections using software.
