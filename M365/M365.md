# Office 365 Interview Questions and Answers

## Introduction to Office 365
Office 365 is a subscription-based service model where users purchase licenses to access various services like Exchange Online, Office applications, Microsoft Teams, SharePoint Online, and OneDrive for Business. It operates under the SaaS (Software as a Service) model—Microsoft manages data storage, security, and maintenance.

## Exchange Online
Exchange Online is a cloud-based messaging platform with email, calendars, contacts, and shared tasks. Users access it through subscription plans (Plan 1, Plan 2, Office 365 business plans). Admins manage it via the Exchange Admin Center (EAC) for email flows, compliance, and security.

## Security Groups
Security groups assign permissions in bulk to users/devices. For example, adding members to a security group assigns licenses/policies efficiently.

## Distribution Groups
Distribution groups require manual membership; dynamic distribution groups use user attributes (e.g., department, location) to determine membership dynamically.

## DNS Records
Key DNS records:
- **TXT**: Domain verification, SPF/DKIM setup
- **MX**: Mail delivery servers
- **CNAME**: Outlook AutoDiscover configuration

## Administrator Roles
- **Global Administrator**: Full control over Microsoft 365
- **Global Reader**: View-only permissions without modification rights

## Shared Mailboxes
Shared mailboxes let multiple users access/send emails from a shared address. Default storage: 50 GB (expandable with license).

## Email Deletion and Retention
Deleted emails:
1. Move to "Deleted Items" (30 days retention)
2. Move to "Recoverable Items" (additional 14 days)

## Retention Tags
Three tags:
- **DPT**: Default Policy Tag
- **RPT**: Retention Policy Tag
- **Personal Tag**: User-applied retention

## Recovery of Deleted Emails
Admins use **eDiscovery/content search** to recover emails beyond user-accessible retention, if no hold is applied.

## Office 365 vs Microsoft 365
Microsoft 365 includes Office 365 **plus** Windows OS and security tools.

## Litigation Hold
Prevents permanent deletion, retains mailbox items for compliance/legal review.

## Blocked Emails
Check **MX records** to troubleshoot blocked inbound emails.

## Identifying Spam Emails
Review **email headers** for spam indicators.

## SPF and DKIM
- **SPF**: Validates sender IP
- **DKIM**: Cryptographic email authentication

## Email Delivery Delays
Analyze **headers and message trace** for latency.

## Conditional Mail Routing
Route mail via specific servers using **connectors and mail flow rules**.

## Advanced Threat Protection
Includes sandbox scanning and **dynamic delivery** for attachment safety.

## Email Structures
- **IPM subtree**: Visible folders
- **Non-IPM subtree**: Recoverable/deleted items

## Online Archive vs Auto-Expanding Archive
Online archive: Separate mailbox; auto-expanding archive grows automatically when space is exhausted.

## Email Relay Methods
- **Client Submission**
- **Direct Send**
- **SMTP Relay**

## Mail Flow Connectors
- **Inbound Connector**: Accepts emails from external servers
- **Outbound Connector**: Sends emails to external servers

## High-Risk Delivery Pool
Routes spam-like emails separately to protect IP reputation.

## PST File Import
Bulk import via **network upload**.

## Migration Types
- **Cutover Migration**: ≤2000 mailboxes
- **Staged Migration**: Larger environments

## Troubleshooting Sending Issues
Check **NDRs and message logs**.

## Global Address List (GAL)
Lists all mail-enabled recipients.

## Mail-Enabled vs Mail-Disabled Recipients
- **Mail-enabled**: Have email addresses
- **Mail-disabled**: No email addresses (permissions only)

## Domain Usage
- **Routable domain**: Publicly accessible
- **Non-routable domain**: Private/internal only

## Zero Auto Purge
Automatically scans/removes spam/malware.

## Identifying Connecting IP
Header analysis shows the sending IP.

## Spam Confidence Level (SCL)
Numerical spam likelihood indicator.

## Spoof Emails
Check header sender path for inconsistencies; configure **mail flow rules** for anti-spoofing.

## Email Flow Rules
- **Transport Rules**: Applied in transit
- **Inbox Rules**: Applied post-delivery

## False Positives/Negatives
Report via **Microsoft 365 Defender**.

## eDiscovery
Run searches on mailboxes for compliance/legal cases.

## Audit Logs
Track actions like deletions/permission changes.

## Exchange Web Services (EWS)
API for mailbox access and integration.

## Authentication Types
- **Basic Auth**: Deprecated
- **Modern Auth**: MFA, token-based security

## Connection Filter
Initial filtering in **Exchange Online Protection** using IP reputation.

## Message Trace
Track email flow, rule application, and delivery status.

## Licensing Differences
**E3 vs E5**: E5 includes advanced security/compliance features.

## Mailbox Plans
Defines quota, retention, and properties on mailbox creation.

## Postmaster Address
Used to send failure notifications externally.

## FasTrack Deployment
Provides resources/support to migrate to Office 365.

## Troubleshooting Configuration Issues
Check permissions, user settings, and recovery tools.

## Retention Policy Conflicts
Investigate conflicting tags or holds causing policy failures.

## Email Routing Concerns
Check **IP reputation, DNS records, content** if emails marked as spam.

## Conclusion
This document summarizes key topics, concepts, and troubleshooting techniques for Office 365 interview preparation across admin levels.
