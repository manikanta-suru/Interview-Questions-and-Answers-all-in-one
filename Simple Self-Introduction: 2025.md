Good [morning/afternoon], I'm Manikanta, a Senior Consultant with 10 years of experience in Wintel operations, Windows patching, VMware vSphere, backups, and monitoring—primarily working with UK-based Fortune Top 10 companies.

In my current role, I manage and support infrastructure for over 3,000 servers across VMware vCloud, Azure, and AWS environments. I take care of critical data centre operations in locations like London, Studley, and Birmingham.

My daily work includes proactive server monitoring, patching, managing backups with Acronis and Snapshot Manager, handling performance via Nagios and LogicMonitor, and leading bridge calls for high-priority issues. I also help L1/L2 teams and coordinate with vendors to ensure smooth operations.

I'm responsible for KPI reports, patching status updates, and AMC contract management. In addition to my hands-on experience, I’m an AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate and part of the AWS Community Builders program, which helps me design reliable, secure, and cost-effective cloud solutions.

Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. I'm excited to see how I can contribute to your team with my expertise.
